        <p>Manechat follows a certain set of rules that we expect participants to follow. Breaking the rules may result in being muted, kicked, or banned from the server.</p>
		 
		<p>Fundamentally, the same rules that apply in the /r/MyLittlePony subreddit also apply to Manechat.</p>
            
        <ol> 
            <li>No offensive/nsfw avatars, pictures, or topics. This includes NSFW emotes, politics and religion.
                <ol type="a">
                    <li>Absolutely NO NSFW roleplays are allowed in the RP channel. Keep it family friendly. (Think E rating on FimFiction)</li>
                </ol>
            </li>
        
            <li>Spoiler rules apply. No spoilers for 48 hours after a new episode airs, nor publicly linking to leaked content. All of this must be kept in the relevant spoilers channel, <span class="channel_name">#mylittlespoilers</span></li>
        
            <li>Spamming and shitposting in the server don't contribute to the discussion and are therefore strictly prohibited. Don’t use Emoji or high unicode in usernames or excessively in text.<br>
			This covers any content or conversation that consists of low-effort memes or other unsubstantial drivel.<br>
            Please note: Unwarranted use of emotes larger than roughly four times the size of the /r/MyLittlePony subreddit’s emotes is prohibited.</li>
		 
			<li>Be pony-like and kind to other members. Abusing any aspect of the chat and/or its systems, such as pinging users, emotes, invites, etc. can be considered grounds for a ban.
				<ol type="a">
                    <li>Be respectful of other users in the voice chat; if someone is talking, use common sense and don't interrupt them. All server rules apply to the voice channels as well; keep the channels SFW.</li>
                    <li>Please properly calibrate your microphones when attending the voice channels to reduce noise. If your environment is inherently prone to white noise, you may be required to enable Push to Talk.</li>
                </ol>
            </li>
        
            <li>Bots and the use of bots in the Discord server are strictly prohibited and are subject to immediate removal from the server without prior warning. <a href="https://github.com/blackhole12/sweetiebot">Sweetie Bot</a>, created and operated by the moderation staff, is the only exception to this rule.</li>
        
            <li>Respect <a href="https://discordapp.com/tos">Discord's Terms of Service</a>. Violations can lead to users being banned and reported to Discord.</li>
            
            <li>We are not a support group. You should not dwell on life crisis issues on the /r/MyLittlePony server. If you need help, please visit the <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/mylittlesupportgroup">My Little Support Group subreddit</a>, the <a href="https://discord.gg/0i3tTVbTo6cyvyPe">My Little Support Group Discord server</a> or contact a local professional in your area. Here's a handy <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/SWResources/comments/2dnji0/hotline_numbers/">International List of Crisis Hotlines</a>.</li>
                
            <p>Certain channels are to be used for certain activities and discussions. <strong>DO NOT</strong> clutter the general chat with content that belongs somewhere else. The purposes of each channel are as follows:<br>
                <table>
                    <tr> <td><span class="channel_name">#manechat</span></td> <td>General discussion.</td> </tr>
                    <tr> <td><span class="channel_name">#overflow</span></td> <td>General discussion channel #2. For when #manechat becomes overcrowded.</td> </tr>
                    <tr> <td><span class="channel_name">#mylittlespoilers</span></td> <td>Spoilers channel to discuss embargoed topics such as new MLP/EqG/comic content and other new media.</td> </tr>
                    <tr> <td><span class="channel_name">#mylittleactivities</span></td> <td>Chat here for gaming, Fanfic Reading reactions or TSSSF communication.</td> </tr>
                    <tr> <td><span class="channel_name">#mylittleroleplay</span></td> <td>This is a SFW RP channel. NSFW is strictly prohibited.</td> </tr>
                    <tr> <td><span class="channel_name">#mylittlenerds</span></td> <td>Technical discussions on computer science and software development as well as the latest tech and similar.</td> </tr>
                    <tr> <td><span class="channel_name">#mylittlebot</span></td> <td>Play with Sweetie Bot's extended functions in here.</td> </tr>
                    <tr> <td><span class="channel_name">#announcements</span></td> <td>Important and useful moderator announcements and notifications to everyone.</td> </tr>
                </table>
